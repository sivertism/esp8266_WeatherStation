    freeBus()

    Dirty hack to release I2C bus if slave locked SDA low

    NOTE:
    - i2c bus status reply:
        - I2C_SDA_HELD_LOW            1, SDA held low by another device, no procedure available to recover
        - I2C_SCL_HELD_LOW_AFTER_READ 4, SCL held low beyond slave clock stretch time, increase stretch time
        - I2C_SDA_OK                  5, SDA free
        - I2C_SDA_RELEASED            6, SDA released after use by another device
    - if SDA stuck LOW, the master should send 9 clock pulses. The device
      that held the bus LOW should release it sometime within those 9 clocks.
      If not, then use the MCU HW reset or cycle power to clear the bus
    - see Analog Device application note AN-686 for more details
    - bus frequency is equal to first SCL = 1 / (tLOW + tHIGH),
                                      SCL = 1 / (4.7μsec + 4.0μsec) = 115kHz

    twi_init

    Initialisation of software/bit-bang master I2C bus protocol

    NOTE:
    - normaly I2C bus drivers are "open drain", meaning that they can pull the
      corresponding signal line low, but cannot drive it high. Thus, there can
      be no bus contention where one device is trying to drive the line high
      while another tries to pull it low, eliminating the potential for damage
      to the drivers or excessive power dissipation in the system. Each signal
      line has a pull-up resistor on it, to restore the signal to high when no
      device is asserting it low
    - however this driver used INPUT_PULLUP, because people forgetting about
      external pull up resistors, so the code has changed a bit recently.
      Instead of changing pin output register when banging the bits, we now
      change pin mode register. The pin is switched between INPUT_PULLUP &
      OUTPUT modes, which makes it either a weak pull up or a strong pull down
      (output register has 0 written into it in advance)
